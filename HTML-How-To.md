## Boilerplates

Every HTML needs to have a boilerplate at the start of the file. Boilerplates are templates to use and start your HTML projects. Listed below is a picture of a simple HTML boilerplate.

* The first line tells the computer what file type you will be typing your file in. (HTML 5)
* The second line tells the computer what language you will be doing your work in. (English)
* The third and ninth line include a head tag which holds computer-readable information. 
* Inside the header, (lines 4 through 6) is called metadata. This is data that describes the file to the computer.
* Line 7 includes the title of the webpage. The text inbetween the title tags changes the text of the browser bar of your website. 
* The 8th and last line in the head tag includes the CSS stylesheet. This sheet is linked from a seperate file to change the appearnce and layout of your html. 
* Line 10 and 12 of the boilerplate include the body tag of the html file which is where you will be placing all of your documents contents.
* Line 11 includes the external JavaScript tags which will link your seperate JavaScript file to your HTML. 
* The 13th and last line of the boilerplate ends you html tag and completes your html file altogether. 

## HTML Body Tags and How to write them


#### HTML Header Tags

Header tags are used to define titles in your html file. You can either write the tag as a simple _header_ or can write the tag from _h1_ to _h6_ depending on what size you want your header. The _h1_ header is the largest while the _h6_ header is thr smallest. Inbetween the two tags, you will type the content you want to be your header. (This is how all content is inputed in HTML) Below is a picture of how to type a header in html and the output of the text written.

#### HTML Paragraph Tags

Paragraph tags are simple to use in your HTML file. These tags can simply be defined as _p_ and will seperate your content into a seperate block of text. Below is an example of how paragraphs are typed in HTML.

#### HTML Image Tags

Image tags are used to input an image on an html page. The tag includes four attributes, these are a src, alt, height and width. The src provides the path to the image while the alt provides the alternate text of the image if the image cannot be displayed. The height and width attributes provide how tall and wide you want the image to appear on your HTML.

#### HTML Video Tags

Video tags are very similar to image tags. Both need a width, height, and src in order to function correctly. The alternate text for a video is slightly different than an image. The alternate text for a video is simply written after the video src is listed between the video tag. The video also needs to have a set of controls in order to play, pause and change the volume of the video. After listing the width and height in the first video tag, type the word controls before closing the first tag. This will give your video controls! You also need to list the type of video after you provide the source. (mp4s, ogg, etc).
